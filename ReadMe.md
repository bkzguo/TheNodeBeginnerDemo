# DEMO FOR THE NODE BEGINNER BOOK
> Coded by bkzguo

This is a functional demo from the book "The Node Beginner Book">" by Manuel Kessling

## KNOWN ISSUE
1. Rename image error.  This issue occurs when your code is in a different partition from your computer's system tmp folder.  For example like me using Windows 7, the system tmp folder is in C:/ while my code was placed to E:/

__Workaround:__ put your code folder to C:/.    _This is what this demo use._

__Possible Solution:__ There's a post in StackOverFlow about this issue, and [DaveGauer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9145900/nodjs-formidable-header-error/19237209#19237209) posted his solution.  Haven't tried it yet but it's worth for you to take a look.
